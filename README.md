Site is repo managed -- master branch is production / development is staging/dev

This is basic info for any development setups

### DEVELOPMENT ###

URL to download upload directory files: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7dzrs05b0jmmbw8/uploads.zip?dl=0

Database is in downloads here
     Set the etc/host to swagtron.dev
     Database is already set with swagtron.dev (if not, use string replace)

To do: remove recaptcha plugin from tracking -- for now you'll have to disable it to get in the admin backend because localhost is not allowed by default domain
